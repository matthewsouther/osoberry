## Osoberry School Philosophy

At Osoberry School we teach and lead with emotional wellbeing in mind. 
While modern life seems to always be running too quickly, Osoberry 
School provides a space to slow down and focus on life’s meaningful 
connections. Utilizing discoveries in mindfulness, the science of 
happiness, child development, and the Finnish education model, our day 
provides kids, teachers and families with a space to experience a 
balanced, meaningful life.

# How We Get There

## *For the Kids*

### Deep, Meaningful Academics

In small groups we are able to go deep with academics. Teachers at Osoberry School use a holistic approach to education and weave the arts and sciences into the daily routine. For math and language arts, kids move into groups based on strengths and areas of growth so we can focus on just what they need. Teachers use hands-on, experiential, and relevant activities to spark curiosity. They teach the power of using courage to show up for juicy struggles and challenges and celebrate the satisfaction of a job well done.

### Social Connection

Happiness and inner balance always come back to strong social connections. At Osoberry School, we prioritize these connections through play, multi-age classes, cross-class connections, and time working on meaningful activities together. We teach group decision making strategies and conflict resolution skills that put the relationship first.

### Play

Play is a fundamental part of being a kid, and supports development in creativity, problem solving, risk taking, emotional regulation, and self-esteem. At Osoberry School, we value play as equal to academic work, and always prioritize time for it.

### Freedom to Explore Interests

Kids at Osoberry School are given time and space to explore personal interests during Choice Time. This is when you’ll find kids experimenting with an art technique, tapping out a song on the keyboard, engineering a house for their stuffed animals, and so much more.

### Nature

As little as two hours a week spent in nature greatly improves your emotional wellbeing. Kids at Osoberry School spend at least one hour outside every day, and spend every Friday immersed in rich nature play and exploration.

### Stability and Routine

Stability and routine in our days provides a safe container for exploration and engagement in rich, satisfying challenges. Most of our time together is structured in a reliable routine that puts the kids at ease. They know when breaks are coming, when we will tackle a juicy challenge, and when they get to explore their own interests freely. We begin and end our days with group meetings that provide connection, warm-up time, and closure.

### Respect

When kids are given respect as unique and important beings, they are able to show up as their best selves.

#### At Osoberry school, teachers show respect by:

* Being prepared and experts in child development
* Listening and adjusting as needed
* Holding boundaries for the group and the learning experience
* Leading with humor, curiosity, and warmth

#### Kids show respect by:

* Using skills in turn-taking
* Participating in activities
* Showing up to solve conflicts
* Earnestly trying their best

## *For the Teachers*

### Time to plan

Teachers at Osoberry School are given ample time throughout the week to do the important work of planning for their lessons. 

### Regular breaks

Just like kids need regular breaks to recharge, so do grown-ups. Teachers at Osoberry School have regular breaks throughout the day to take care of themselves and recharge.

### Respect and esteem

Teachers at Osoberry School are highly valued for their dedication and training in education. They are given time and autonomy to be their best selves in the classroom.

### Small class sizes

We maintain small class sizes (maximum 14 students) so teachers can have what they went into the profession for in the first place: meaningful relationships with their students, and the space to lead rich, hands-on experiences without needing to resort to demoralizing behavior management strategies.

### Staff connection and bonding

Just as we nurture the social bonds between our students, Osoberry School dedicates time and space to its teachers to enjoy each other and feel connected. When teachers join our school they join a community that likes to spend time together.

## *For the Families*

### Year-round schooling and enrichment

The stress and cost of orchestrating summer camps, wondering if you’ll get in and driving your kids all over town for something different each week of summer is taxing on families’ wellbeing. When your child is enrolled in Osoberry School, you benefit from a year-round schedule where learning happens every season and schedule simplicity rules.

### Communication, Community, and Care

As an intentionally small school everyone gets to know each other quickly! Families can expect strong communication from their child's teacher who cares about each child and family deeply. We pride ourselves on delivering weekly updates and photos about what's happening in class, and scheduling family meetings to address questions and concerns that come up throughout the year.
