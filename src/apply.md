## Admissions Process

Our admissions process is thoughtfully designed to ensure admitted families will be successful at Osoberry School. Our environment isn't right for every child or family. We use the following exploratory process to collaboratively decide if your child will be successful in our program. 

1. [Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/emily-u8ex/osoberry-school-info-session) with Osoberry School Director, Emily Souther. This adults-only conversation is a chance to learn more about the program and ask questions.
2. Complete the [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z6vYODLf0fMiU4QmmeVS1j7qAEgL7W4NZ8mBZ_2A-84/edit) by **February 1st, 2025** for priority enrollment.
3. Visit in-person with your child for an informal interview with the Director. This is a chance for us to get to know your child, and for your child to get to know us. It's very important to Osoberry School that the kids who attend are excited to join our community. If your child refuses or lacks the skills to participate, Osoberry School will not be a good space for them to be successful. 
4. Schedule a shadow day for your child to visit the class. This is a full drop off day for your child to experience how we learn at Osoberry School. 
5. We will contact you in early April regarding your enrollment. You will have three days to sign the enrollment contract and pay a deposit to hold your spot.

### Kids who are successful at Osoberry School:

* Are curious and excited to learn
* Are respectful and responsible
* Want to be part of a strong community
* Enjoy spending time outside in all weather
* Are open to feedback and pushing through challenges
