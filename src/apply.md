## *Application Process*

### Start something new with us!

### We are currently accepting applications for our first cohort of students.

We will be opening our school in fall 2024 with one class of mixed 3rd/4th graders. The following year we will have two mixed age classes: 1st/2nd grade and 3rd-5th grade. Our third year we will grow to three mixed age classes: 1st/2nd, 3rd/4th, & 5th/6th.

#### Application Process:

1. Schedule a call or in-person meeting with Emily Souther, the director. This is an adults-only conversation and is a chance to learn more about the program and ask questions.
2. Complete the application.
3. Visit in-person with your child for an informal interview with the director. This is a chance to get to know your child, and for your child to get to know us. It's very important to Osoberry School that the kids who attend are excited to join our community.
4. We will contact you within 1-2 weeks regarding acceptance and you will have 3 days to pay a $200 deposit to hold your spot.

#### Kids who are successful at Osoberry School are:

* Curious and excited to learn
* Self-directed and also able to follow directions
* Want to be part of a strong community
* Enjoy spending time outside in all weather
* Open to feedback and pushing through challenges

### Tuition

As we increase enrollment we hope to have scholarships available for those who need it. We do not currently have financial aid available.

* **5 days per week:** $1,300/month for 11 months; includes all supplies and aftercare
* **Forest Fridays only:** $300/month for 11 months; hours run 8:30-5pm and include aftercare on site
