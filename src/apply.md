## Application Process

### *Start something new with us!*

![](/assets/uploads/dice.jpg)

### We are currently accepting applications for our first cohort of students.

As we get started growing this new community, our 2024/25 school year will look a little different than following years. 

We will be opening our school with one class of mixed age Kindergarten-2nd graders. We will operate on a reduced schedule: **Monday-Thursday 9am-2:30pm, September-July.** As we grow we will hire additional staff to implement our full program. 

To provide Forest Fridays, families can sign up for [Trackers Homeschool Fridays program. ](https://www.trackerspdx.com/youth/school-year/homeschool/trackers-outdoor-homeschool/)

We plan to grow over the years with multiple mixed-age classes and serve K-6th grade.

#### Admissions Process

Our admissions process is thoughtfully designed to ensure admitted families will be successful at Osoberry School. Our environment isn't right for every child or family. We use the following exploratory process to collaboratively decide if your child will be successful in our program. 

1. [Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/emily-u8ex/osoberry-school-info-session) with Osoberry School Director Emily Souther. This adults-only conversation is a chance to learn more about the program and ask questions.
2. Complete the [application](https://forms.gle/YPW8pkDc4gxgxHMx8).
3. Visit in-person with your child for an informal interview with the Director. This is a chance for us to get to know your child, and for your child to get to know us. It's very important to Osoberry School that the kids who attend are excited to join our community. If your child refuses or lacks the skills to participate, Osoberry School will not be a good space for them to be successful. 
4. Schedule a shadow day for your child to visit the class. This is a full drop off day for your child to experience how we learn at Osoberry School. 
5. We will contact you within 1 week regarding acceptance. You will have three days to sign the enrollment contract and pay a deposit to hold your spot.

#### Kids who are successful at Osoberry School:

* Are curious and excited to learn
* Are respectful and responsible
* Want to be part of a strong community
* Enjoy spending time outside in all weather
* Are open to feedback and pushing through challenges

### Tuition
