### We are currently accepting applications for our first cohort of students.

We will be opening our school in fall 2024 with one class of mixed 1st-4th graders. As soon as we hit enough enrolled students we will open two separate classes: 1st/2nd grade and 3rd-4th.

In Fall 2025, we will have two classes: 1st/2nd and 3rd-5th grade. By the 3rd year we plan to have three mixed age classes: 1st/2nd, 3rd/4th, and 5th/6th.

#### Application Process:

1. Schedule a call or in-person meeting with Emily Souther, the director. This is an adults-only conversation and is a chance to learn more about the program and ask questions.
2. Complete the [application.](https://forms.gle/YPW8pkDc4gxgxHMx8)
3. Visit in-person with your child for an informal interview with the director. This is a chance to get to know your child, and for your child to get to know us. It's very important to Osoberry School that the kids who attend are excited to join our community.
4. We will contact you within 1-2 weeks regarding acceptance and you will have 3 days to pay a $200 deposit to hold your spot.

#### Kids who are successful at Osoberry School are:

- Curious and excited to learn
