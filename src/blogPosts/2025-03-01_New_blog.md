Hey People, 

Let's start off with a little reflection. Take a minute to reach back into your brain twenty, thirty, forty years ago. You were five and heading into *Kindergarten.* 

What do you remember from that time? 

What feelings are you noticing? 

What did you like and what did you not like? 

I've led many families through this exercise to help ground their understanding of what they want from their child's Kindergarten experience. I hear a lot of things like this:

"I remember the play kitchen and setting up a restaurant with my friends."

"I remember being outside and playing in the dirt under a tree."

"I remember my teacher feeling like a warm person." 



I'm a parent too, but when I was looking at K options for my boys I had a secret weapon: I'm a Teacher. There are little things to look for when entering a school that probably go unnoticed by the untrained eye. These are what I'm looking for and thinking about when evaluating a kindergarten program. 

### 8 Markers of a Quality Kindergarten Program

1. **Time for Play**

Hands down, I'm a play advocate. Kids learn through play. They practice new skills, build friendships, experiment, tinker, explore, wonder, and have fun. They process new information through play that allows their brains to store it and make sense of it in new ways. 

Too many kindergarten programs have moved away from a daily routine filled with play and replaced these times with seat work. Five year olds still have a lot of energy to burn and an innate curiosity we want to nurture not squash. 

*Question to ask: How much time do kids get for free play?*

1. **Nurturing Innate Curiosity** 

Kids are born curious. Remember all those "whys" they asked as three and four year olds? Kids have a long school path ahead of them and they should not be burned out by first grade. Slowing down and allowing kids to explore their curiosity gives an almost instantaneous boost to their self esteem and wellbeing. 

Curiosity is the skill we cultivate in scientists and mathematicians. It's what we want when our kids go to college. Schools can nurture this by offering lots of exploration into science, playful math, reading stories together, exploring the things kids are interested in, and just sitting in awe together of a spider spinning a web.

*Question to ask: How do you bring student interests into your curriculum and support curiosity in the classroom?*  

1. **Social Emotional Development** 
2. **Creative Expression** 
3. **Class Size & Student Teacher Ratio** 
4. **Teacher Turn Over Rate**
5. **Growth Through the Grades**
6. **Communication**
