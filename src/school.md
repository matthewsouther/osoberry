# School

We are a small school making a big difference for the families we serve. We believe it's essential to provide a space in our education landscape for families and kids looking for a smaller, more nurturing, and individualized schooling experience.

We believe in: 

* Building strong relationships
* Knowing each child well 
* Low competition environments
* Creative expression 
* Just right challenges for each child
* Hands-on, active work and exploration

Our students are kind, thoughtful, creative, and curious. Some of our families come to Osoberry School after feeling unsatisfied in their neighborhood school. Other families recognize from the beginning they want *something more* for their unique child. 

We are a new school growing into our full program. Please visit the [Apply Page](https://osoberry.school/apply/) for current school details. 

When fully enrolled, our program will have:

* About 40 students divided into three classes, serving 5-11 year olds: Youngers, Middles, Olders
* Max class sizes of 14 students
* Two teachers per class
* Flexible drop-off from 8:30-9am and pick-up from 3-5pm 
* An extended school year running Sept.-July
* Dedicated nature immersion on Fridays 
* Drop in specialists for music, art, and nature
