## How We Teach and Learn

Teachers at Osoberry School know best practices in learning and utilize hands-on, experiential activities and project based units of study. We not only teach foundational academics but we teach kids how to learn and nurture their innate curiosity and joy.

Each class follows a 2 year cycle of learning as they loop with their teacher. Math and Language Arts are taught in small groups based on skill development. By working in mixed-age classrooms, students are able to benefit from the experience of being a younger mentee and then an older mentor.

## Curriculum Focus by Class

***3rd/4th grade***

In 3rd grade **math** students will focus on:

* Continuing practice and fluency with addition & subtraction through 1000
* Learning and practicing multiplication 
* Gaining a concrete understanding of division
* Work with basic fractions to understand equal parts 



In 4th grade **math** students will focus on: 

* Mastery of multiplication/division in useful situations
* Play and practice with fractions including mixed fractions 
* Introduction to decimals 
* Using operations flexibly
* Building and designing with shapes and angles



We use a combination of curriculums (Math for Love, Mindset Mathematics, Do the Math) and teacher created lessons. We focus on using hands-on materials and math games to develop a concrete and flexible understanding of math concepts. 



**Language Art** students will focus on: 

* Reading for joy 
* Reading a variety of texts including non-fiction, fiction, and poetry
* Developing research skills using printed and online materials 
* Learning and practicing skills for book discussions
* Fluency in writing fictional and personal narrative stories, informational texts, and poetry 

We use a combination of curriculums (Writing Workshop by Lucy Calkins, Brave Writer, Words Their Way Spelling ) and teacher created lessons to build authentic and joyful uses of reading and writing. For students needing more focused reading/writing instruction we utilize Structured Literacy approaches in small group pull-outs. We combine our Language Arts lessons with thematic units in Social Studies and Science, and integrate the arts whenever possible as a mode for storytelling.
