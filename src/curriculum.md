## Curriculum

Teachers at Osoberry School know best practices in learning and utilize hands-on, experiential activities and project based units of study. We not only teach foundational academics but we teach kids how to learn and nurture their innate curiosity and joy.

Each class follows a 2 year cycle of learning as they loop with their teacher. Math and Language Arts are taught in small groups based on skill development. By working in mixed-age classrooms, students are able to benefit from the experience of being a younger mentee and then an older mentor.
