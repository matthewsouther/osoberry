# About the Teachers

### Emily Souther, Board President, Founder & Head Teacher

* Certified K-6 Teacher
* MA in Curriculum and Instruction
* 16 years classroom teaching experience
* Parent of 2 joyful learners

I am a person with many passions and a deep enthusiasm for life and learning. I explore the world through music, art, literature, science, and the outdoors, but my deepest passion—and truly my life’s work—is working with children.

I have been an educator in public and private schools since 2008. I began my teaching experience in a highly progressive school in Menlo Park, California. This was a place where children and the valuable work they do—play—was deeply respected. Here I learned the importance of giving children trust to know the abilities of their bodies, to take physical, social, and intellectual risks, and to ask for help when they need it. As an educator, I believe I am tasked with being a guide and mentor to the children I work with. I teach my students reading and math, but I also encourage leadership in the children, hold group meetings to resolve social conflicts, and listen carefully to understand each child’s interests and motivations in the world.

Since then I have continued to grow as an educator and have honed my “learn-by-doing” philosophy through teaching work at a variety of school types—public, private, and a homeschool resource center.

At the heart of my teaching philosophy is the belief that to build self-confident, happy, and excited-to-learn children, we must first meet each child where they are and allow them to explore their own ideas about how to approach a problem or learn a new concept. Children are born excited to learn and it is our most vital role as adults and educators to nurture that.

I live in Northeast Portland with my husband and two sons. You'll often find us exploring nature, being silly, having dance parties, and reveling in the joy of learning.

### Susan Eisman, Youngers Teacher

Susan Eisman is a visionary children’s educator and community leader with 35 years of experience. Her practice includes play based education, environmental education, anti-bias education, and peace activism. 

Susan fosters meaningful relationships as the foundation for all learning. She emphasizes joyful and transformative connections to promote a love of learning, appreciation of self and others, and interconnectedness with the natural world.  

Susan is a fierce advocate for valuing individual learning styles, social-emotional intelligence, social problem-solving skills, and inquiry based learning. She emphasizes seasonal curriculum, daily outdoor exploration, and integrates nature into the curriculum as strategies to restore our human connection to the rest of nature. She nourishes children’s curiosity and connection with the ways we are the same and different, and talks about what’s fair and not fair to support children’s changemaker spirits within. 

Partnering with children and their families brings Susan great joy. She delights in learning alongside children, and finds that children’s unique perspectives, insights and expressions are often her personal highlights at the end of the day. 

When she is not facilitating activities with young people, families and teachers, you might find Susan gardening, river rafting, or curled up with her two cats and a book.

I am so pleased to be a part of Osoberry’s mission to bring authentic and joyful education to Portland families. My days are filled with homeschooling my tween-age kids, immersing myself in math and writing pedagogy, gardening with my family, and drawing in my sketchbook. My background includes a degree in fine art, a ten-year fundraising career for colleges and non-profits, previous board positions, and an insatiable curiosity for education theory and practice.
