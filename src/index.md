## *Connection, Wellbeing, Authentic Learning*

At Osoberry School we teach and lead with emotional wellbeing in mind. While modern life seems to always be running too quickly, Osoberry School provides a space to slow down and focus on lifeâ€™s meaningful connections. Utilizing discoveries in mindfulness, the science of happiness, child development, and the Finnish education model, our day provides kids, teachers and families with a space to experience a balanced, meaningful life.

> *"We highly recommend Emily and the Osoberry School. For the first time, our son is excited to go to school. He tells us that learning at Osoberry is "fun and not boring." Emily connected with our child right away and her curriculum and teaching style is exactly what we want for our child."*
