## _Connection, Wellbeing, Authentic Learning_

At Osoberry School we teach and lead with emotional wellbeing in mind. While modern life seems to always be running too quickly, Osoberry School provides a space to slow down and focus on lifeâ€™s meaningful connections. Utilizing discoveries in mindfulness, the science of happiness, child development, and the Finnish Education Model, our day provides kids, teachers and families with a space to experience a balanced, meaningful life.
