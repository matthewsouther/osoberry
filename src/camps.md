### Summer Camps

We will be offering summer camps June 23rd-July 24th. Sign ups coming soon!

**[Join ](http://eepurl.com/iOiTlM)[our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/iOiTlM) to be the first to hear updates about camps and other Osoberry events.**

**Details:** 

Each week will include a daily rhythm with a balance of structured and unstructured time. Our days will be filled with games, outdoor play, dedicated activities based on that week's theme and free choice play. Thursdays are a dedicated nature day where we walk to Laurelhurst Park for nature crafts and play. 

**Hours:** Monday-Thursday 9am-2:30pm 

**Ages:** 5-8 year olds

**Cost:** $250/week or $1125 for all 5 weeks (that's $125 off) 

**Location:** Osoberry School 4433 E Burnside St. Portland

We prioritize small class sizes, this means spaces are limited!

**Themes by week:**

**Week 1 - June 23-26: All About Animals**

**Week 2 - June 30-July 3: Lotions and Potions**

**Week 3 - July 7-10: Craft Creations**
